# The ppm format can be very fun

In this very quick project I had fun generating images in the ppm format. Therefore, you should have a program able to open this format to visualise them. This format consists of a very simple header (see code) followed by the rgb values of each pixel.
 
The images are simply generated by having the values of each pixel be a function of its coordinate.
